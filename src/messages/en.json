        "p1": "Natural numbers are the counting numbers you use every day: 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. They are the very first numbers you learn, and they help you count objects, compare amounts, and understand the idea of \"how many.\" Zero is sometimes included too, giving you a starting point for the number line.",
        "p2": "Understanding natural numbers is the foundation for all of mathematics. Once you are comfortable counting, ordering, and comparing these numbers, you can move on to addition, subtraction, and everything else that builds on top of them."
      },
      "de-fire-regnearter": {
        "p1": "The four operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — are the basic tools you use to work with numbers. Addition combines quantities, subtraction finds the difference, multiplication is repeated addition, and division splits a quantity into equal parts.",
        "p2": "These four operations appear everywhere in daily life, from splitting a bill to figuring out how many days until your birthday. Mastering them gives you the skills to solve problems quickly and confidently, and they form the backbone of every branch of mathematics you will encounter later."
      },
      "hele-tal": {
        "p1": "Integers extend the natural numbers by including zero and negative numbers: ..., −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... You need negative numbers to describe things like temperatures below zero, debts, or elevations below sea level.",
        "p2": "Learning to add, subtract, multiply, and divide with negative numbers opens up a whole new range of problems you can solve. Integers are essential for algebra and for understanding how the number line stretches in both directions from zero."
      },
      "broeker": {
        "p1": "A fraction represents a part of a whole. When you write 3/4, you are saying you have three out of four equal pieces. Fractions let you describe quantities that fall between whole numbers, like half a pizza or a quarter of an hour.",
        "p2": "Working with fractions — comparing them, adding them, multiplying them — is a skill you will use throughout mathematics and everyday life. Understanding fractions also prepares you for decimals, percentages, and algebra, where they appear constantly."
      },
      "decimaltal": {
        "p1": "Decimals are another way to write fractions, using a decimal point and place values like tenths, hundredths, and thousandths. For example, 0.75 means the same as 3/4. You see decimals on price tags, measuring tools, and calculators every day.",
        "p2": "Being comfortable with decimals means you can handle money, measurements, and scientific data with ease. You will learn to add, subtract, multiply, and divide decimals, and to convert freely between decimals and fractions."
      },
      "procent": {
        "p1": "A percentage is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. When you say 25%, you mean 25 out of 100, which is the same as 1/4. Percentages make it easy to compare parts of different-sized groups on a common scale.",
        "p2": "You encounter percentages everywhere: discounts in shops, test scores, battery levels, and statistics in the news. Learning to calculate percentages, and to convert between percentages, fractions, and decimals, is one of the most practical math skills you can have."
      },
      "potenser-og-roedder": {
        "p1": "A power (or exponent) is a shorthand for repeated multiplication: 2³ means 2 × 2 × 2 = 8. A root is the reverse operation: √9 = 3 because 3² = 9. Together, powers and roots let you work with very large or very small numbers efficiently.",
        "p2": "Powers and roots appear in area and volume calculations, scientific notation, compound interest, and many formulas in physics and chemistry. Once you understand them, you unlock a powerful set of tools for simplifying and solving more advanced problems."
      },
      "talteoretiske-begreber": {
        "p1": "Number theory studies the properties of whole numbers. You explore ideas like prime numbers (numbers divisible only by 1 and themselves), factors, multiples, divisibility rules, and the greatest common divisor. These concepts reveal surprising patterns hidden inside ordinary numbers.",
        "p2": "Number theory is not just abstract — it is the basis for modern cryptography that keeps your online data secure. Understanding primes and divisibility also makes working with fractions and algebra much easier, because you can simplify expressions with confidence."
      },
      "rationale-og-irrationale-tal": {
        "p1": "Rational numbers are any numbers you can write as a fraction of two integers, like 3/4 or −7/2. Irrational numbers, such as π and √2, cannot be written as a simple fraction — their decimal expansions go on forever without repeating.",
        "p2": "Understanding the difference between these two types of numbers deepens your knowledge of the number system. You learn that the number line is filled with irrational numbers hiding between the rationals, and this insight is essential for advanced algebra, geometry, and calculus."
      },
      "regnearternes-hierarki": {
        "p1": "The order of operations is a set of rules that tells you which calculations to do first in an expression. You handle brackets first, then powers, then multiplication and division (left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (left to right).",
        "p2": "Without these rules, the same expression could give different answers depending on who reads it. Learning the order of operations ensures that everyone interprets a mathematical expression in the same way, which is essential as your calculations become more complex."
      },
      "grundlaeggende-algebra": {
        "p1": "Algebra introduces letters (like x and y) to stand for unknown or variable quantities. Instead of just working with specific numbers, you learn to write general rules and relationships, such as the formula for the area of a rectangle: A = l × w.",
        "p2": "This shift from numbers to symbols is one of the most important steps in mathematics. Algebra lets you solve problems where something is unknown, describe patterns, and build formulas that work in every situation — skills that are used in science, engineering, economics, and everyday problem-solving."
      },
      "ligninger": {
        "p1": "An equation is a statement that two expressions are equal, and solving it means finding the value of the unknown that makes it true. For example, 2x + 3 = 11 is solved when x = 4. You learn systematic methods like isolating the variable by doing the same operation to both sides.",
        "p2": "Equations are everywhere: calculating distances, converting currencies, balancing budgets, and modelling scientific phenomena. The ability to set up and solve equations is one of the most broadly useful skills in all of mathematics."
      },
      "ligningssystemer": {
        "p1": "A system of equations is two or more equations with the same unknowns that must all be true at the same time. For example, you might need to find x and y that satisfy both x + y = 10 and 2x — y = 5 simultaneously.",
        "p2": "You learn methods like substitution and elimination to find the solution. Systems of equations arise whenever multiple conditions must be met at once — in physics, economics, engineering, and optimisation problems. They also connect beautifully to the geometry of intersecting lines."
      },
      "parentesregler-og-faktorisering": {
        "p1": "Bracket rules tell you how to expand expressions like (a + b)(a — b), while factorisation is the reverse process: rewriting an expression as a product of simpler factors. Both skills rely on the distributive law and are essential for simplifying algebraic expressions.",
        "p2": "Mastering these techniques makes it much easier to solve equations, simplify fractions, and work with polynomials. Factorisation is especially powerful because it can turn a complicated expression into a form where you can immediately read off solutions or simplify further."
      },
      "andengradsligninger": {
        "p1": "A quadratic equation has the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where the highest power of the unknown is 2. You can solve these using the quadratic formula, by factorising, or by completing the square. A quadratic equation can have two solutions, one solution, or no real solutions.",
        "p2": "Quadratic equations model many real-world situations: the path of a thrown ball, the area of a changing rectangle, or the profit of a business. Understanding them is a gateway to higher-level mathematics and gives you powerful tools for analysing curved relationships."
      },
      "polynomier": {
        "p1": "A polynomial is an expression like 3x³ — 2x² + 5x — 1, built from variables and constants using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents. The degree of the polynomial tells you its highest power and determines the overall shape of its graph.",
        "p2": "You learn to add, multiply, divide, and factorise polynomials, and to find their roots. Polynomials are among the most important objects in mathematics because they can approximate almost any function, and they appear in physics, computer science, and engineering."
      },
      "broekregning-med-algebra": {
        "p1": "Algebraic fractions are fractions where the numerator, denominator, or both contain algebraic expressions, like (x² — 1)/(x + 1). You learn to simplify them by factorising and cancelling common factors, and to add, subtract, multiply, and divide them just as you do with numerical fractions.",
        "p2": "Working confidently with algebraic fractions is essential for solving advanced equations, working with functions, and doing calculus. These skills tie together your knowledge of fractions and algebra into a unified toolkit for handling complex mathematical expressions."
      },
      "logaritmer": {
        "p1": "A logarithm answers the question: \"What exponent do I need?\" If 10² = 100, then log₁₀(100) = 2. Logarithms are the inverse of exponentiation, just as subtraction is the inverse of addition. You learn the rules for combining and simplifying logarithmic expressions.",
        "p2": "Logarithms are indispensable in science and engineering because they let you handle extremely large or small numbers on a manageable scale. They appear in measuring earthquakes (Richter scale), sound (decibels), and in solving exponential equations that model growth and decay."
      },
      "komplekse-tal": {
        "p1": "Complex numbers extend the real numbers by introducing i, the imaginary unit, defined by i² = −1. A complex number has the form a + bi, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part. This means every quadratic equation now has solutions, even x² + 1 = 0.",
        "p2": "Complex numbers are far more than a theoretical curiosity. They are used in electrical engineering, quantum physics, signal processing, and fluid dynamics. Learning to add, multiply, and visualise them on the complex plane opens a rich and elegant chapter of mathematics."
      },
      "grundlaeggende-funktionslaere": {
        "p1": "A function is a rule that assigns exactly one output to each input. You can think of it as a machine: you put a number in, and a specific number comes out. Functions are written as f(x), and you learn to read their graphs, tables, and formulas.",
        "p2": "Functions are the language used to describe relationships in mathematics and science — how distance depends on time, how temperature changes through the day, or how cost depends on quantity. Understanding functions is the key to almost all higher-level mathematics."
      },
      "lineaere-funktioner": {
        "p1": "A linear function has the form f(x) = ax + b, and its graph is a straight line. The number a is the slope (how steep the line is) and b is the y-intercept (where the line crosses the vertical axis). You learn to find these values, draw the graph, and interpret them in context.",
        "p2": "Linear functions model constant-rate relationships: a taxi fare that increases steadily per kilometre, a bathtub filling at a fixed rate, or a phone plan with a flat monthly fee plus a per-minute charge. Recognising and working with them is fundamental to algebra, statistics, and science."
      },
      "andengradsfunktioner-parabler": {
        "p1": "A quadratic function has the form f(x) = ax² + bx + c, and its graph is a U-shaped curve called a parabola. The parabola has a vertex (its highest or lowest point), an axis of symmetry, and it may cross the x-axis at zero, one, or two points.",
        "p2": "Quadratic functions describe projectile motion, the shape of satellite dishes, and profit maximisation in business. You learn to find the vertex, roots, and axis of symmetry, and to use these to sketch graphs and solve real-world problems involving curved relationships."
      },
      "potensfunktioner": {
        "p1": "A power function has the form f(x) = b · xᵃ, where the variable x is raised to a constant power a. Depending on whether a is positive, negative, a fraction, or a whole number, the graph takes on very different shapes. You already know some power functions: x² gives a parabola, and x³ gives a cubic curve.",
        "p2": "Power functions model many natural relationships, such as how the area of a circle grows with its radius (A = πr²) or how gravitational force decreases with distance. Recognising a power function in data — often by using logarithmic plots — is a key skill in science and engineering."
      },
      "eksponentialfunktioner": {
        "p1": "An exponential function has the form f(x) = b · aˣ, where the variable is in the exponent. When a > 1 the function grows rapidly; when 0 < a < 1 it decays. Unlike linear growth that adds the same amount each step, exponential growth multiplies by the same factor each step.",
        "p2": "Exponential functions describe population growth, radioactive decay, compound interest, and the spread of diseases. You learn to identify exponential behaviour in data, write the function, and use logarithms to solve exponential equations. These functions are some of the most important in applied mathematics."
      },
      "logaritmefunktioner": {
        "p1": "A logarithmic function is the inverse of an exponential function. If y = aˣ, then x = log_a(y). Its graph rises steeply at first and then levels off, growing more and more slowly. You learn about the natural logarithm (ln) and the common logarithm (log₁₀).",
        "p2": "Logarithmic functions are used to model phenomena where growth slows over time, such as perceived loudness of sound or the pH scale in chemistry. They also help you solve exponential equations and are essential tools in calculus, data science, and information theory."
      },
      "trigonometriske-funktioner": {
        "p1": "The trigonometric functions — sine, cosine, and tangent — can be extended beyond triangles to become functions of any real number. Their graphs are smooth, repeating waves that oscillate between fixed values. You learn about amplitude, period, and phase shift.",
        "p2": "These wave-like functions model anything that repeats: sound waves, tides, seasonal temperatures, and alternating current in electrical circuits. Understanding trigonometric functions and their properties is essential for physics, engineering, and signal processing."
      },
      "funktioners-egenskaber": {
        "p1": "When you study the properties of functions, you examine features like domain and range, whether a function is increasing or decreasing, its symmetry, continuity, and behaviour as x approaches very large or very small values (asymptotes).",
        "p2": "Analysing these properties lets you build a detailed picture of a function without plotting every single point. This skill is central to calculus and mathematical modelling, where you need to understand how a function behaves across its entire domain to draw conclusions and make predictions."
      },
      "transformationer-af-funktioner": {
        "p1": "Transformations let you modify a function's graph by shifting it up, down, left, or right, stretching or compressing it, or reflecting it across an axis. For instance, f(x) + 3 shifts the graph up by 3 units, and f(−x) mirrors it horizontally.",
        "p2": "Understanding transformations means you can quickly sketch the graph of a new function based on one you already know. This saves time and deepens your intuition about how algebraic changes in a formula correspond to visual changes in its graph."
      },
      "grundlaeggende-figurer-og-begreber": {
        "p1": "Geometry starts with basic shapes and ideas: points, lines, angles, triangles, rectangles, and circles. You learn to name shapes, identify their properties, and understand concepts like parallel and perpendicular lines, symmetry, and congruence.",
        "p2": "These building blocks are everywhere in the world around you — in buildings, artwork, road signs, and nature. Learning to see and describe geometric shapes trains your spatial thinking and prepares you for more advanced geometry, measurement, and design."
      },
      "trekanter": {
        "p1": "A triangle is a three-sided polygon, and it is the simplest shape that encloses an area. You learn about different types (equilateral, isosceles, right-angled, scalene), the angle sum property (always 180°), and important features like altitudes, medians, and the circumscribed and inscribed circles.",
        "p2": "Triangles are the foundation of much of geometry and engineering because any polygon can be divided into triangles. You use triangles to calculate heights, distances, and areas, and they lead naturally into trigonometry, one of the most widely applied branches of mathematics."
      },

It contains 15 rows of numbers, all Pythagorean triples — integers satisfying a² + b² = c². The tablet is almost 3,800 years old and is the oldest known evidence that humans were aware of the relationship. The Babylonians had no formal theorem, but they used it in practice for surveying and construction along the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.",

His followers — the Pythagoreans — are credited with the first deductive proof of the theorem: not just \"it works\" but \"it must always work\". Two hundred years later Euclid compiled all known geometry in his masterwork Elements, where the theorem appears as Proposition 47 in Book I with an elegant proof based on area comparison.",

In 2023 two American high-school students, Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson, presented a new proof based purely on trigonometry — something many mathematicians had considered impossible. The theorem is still used daily: engineers calculate distances with it, computer graphics are built on it, GPS navigation depends on it, and it is the cornerstone of all distance measurement in both two and three dimensions."

        "p1": "Numbers are the most fundamental thing in mathematics. From the very first years of school, you work with counting, comparing and understanding what numbers actually mean. Number sense is about having an intuitive feel for numbers — knowing that 100 is much more than 10, that half of 8 is 4, and being able to judge whether an answer is reasonable.",
        "p2": "The four basic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication and division — are the building blocks. Once you master them, you can solve countless everyday problems: sharing sweets fairly, calculating change, or figuring out how many days until the holidays. Arithmetic isn't just something you do at school; it's something you use all the time.",
        "p3": "Gradually, your concept of numbers expands. You learn about negative numbers (what happens when the temperature drops below zero?), fractions (half a pizza, three quarters of an hour) and decimals. Each new type of number opens up new ways of describing reality.",
        "p4": "You encounter percentages everywhere — in shop discounts, grades, statistics and the news. Understanding percentages means being able to translate between parts and wholes, and it's one of the most practical skills mathematics gives you.",
        "p5": "In the older classes and upper secondary school, you dive into powers, roots and number theory. You learn what it means for a number to be prime, how to find the greatest common divisor, and why numbers like π and √2 can never be written as fractions.",
        "p6": "A good number sense is the foundation for everything else in mathematics. The better you understand numbers and arithmetic, the easier algebra, geometry and everything that builds on them becomes."
      },
      "algebra": {
        "p1": "In algebra we use letters like x and y to stand for numbers we don't know yet. Instead of asking \"what number plus 3 equals 10?\" we write x + 3 = 10 — and then we have an equation to solve. That's the core idea of algebra: writing mathematical questions with symbols so we can work our way to the answer step by step.",
        "p2": "You actually use algebra already, perhaps without thinking about it. When you figure out how much money you're short for something you want to buy, you're making an equation in your head: what you have + what you need = the price. Algebra gives you a tool to write that kind of thinking down and solve it precisely.",
        "p3": "When you start with algebra, you first learn to work with simple expressions and equations. You learn to collect like terms, expand brackets, and rearrange an equation so the unknown ends up alone on one side. It's a bit like a puzzle — there are fixed rules, and when you follow them, the answer falls into place.",
        "p4": "Later you meet equations that are more challenging: equations with fractions, with several unknowns, or quadratic equations where x appears squared. You also learn handy shortcuts like the square identities, which make it faster to multiply and factorise expressions. The more techniques you have, the bigger problems you can tackle.",
        "p5": "In upper secondary school you build further with polynomials, logarithms, and eventually complex numbers. But the principle is the same as from the start: you write a problem using symbols and transform it until you have an answer. The tools grow, but the way of thinking stays the same.",
        "p6": "Algebra turns up everywhere in mathematics — in functions, geometry, physics, and economics. It's the shared toolbox that the rest of mathematics relies on. That's why getting comfortable with algebra is a great investment: it makes everything else easier."

      "funktioner": {
        "p1": "A function is a rule that takes a number in and gives a specific number back. Think of it as a machine: you put something in, and something comes out. If the rule is \"multiply by 2\", then input 3 gives output 6, and input 5 gives 10. That's the whole idea.",
        "p2": "Functions are everywhere in daily life, even if you don't always notice. The price of petrol depends on how many litres you fill up. Your pay depends on how many hours you work. The temperature changes throughout the day. All these relationships can be described with functions.",
        "p3": "The graph is the picture of a function. When you plot a function in a coordinate system, you can see its behaviour at a glance: is it rising or falling? How fast? Does it have a peak or a trough? A graph makes the abstract concrete and visual.",
        "p4": "The simplest functions are linear ones — straight lines that rise or fall at a constant rate. From there you meet quadratic functions, which draw parabolas, and exponential functions, which grow explosively fast. Each type of function has its own shape and its own properties.",
        "p5": "In upper secondary school you learn to analyse functions more precisely: where they grow, where they have extrema, how they behave as x gets very large. You also meet trigonometric functions, which oscillate like waves, and logarithmic functions, which are the inverse of exponentials.",
        "p6": "Functions are the language that science and economics use to describe change. From the laws of motion in physics to economic growth models — it's all functions. Being able to read and work with functions is a key skill in almost every subject that uses mathematics."

      "geometri": {
        "p1": "Geometry is about shapes, figures and space. It's the part of mathematics you can see and touch — from triangles and circles on paper to buildings, bridges and balls in the real world. Geometry helps you understand how things are shaped, how big they are, and how they fit together.",
        "p2": "You start with the basic figures: points, lines, triangles, quadrilaterals and circles. You learn to measure angles, calculate perimeters and areas, and you discover rules like the angles in a triangle always adding up to 180°. These rules aren't arbitrary — they follow from the logic of geometry.",
        "p3": "Triangles hold a special place in geometry. They are the simplest shape with area, and they turn up everywhere: in roof structures, bridges, GPS calculations and computer graphics. Understanding triangles — their sides, angles and areas — is a cornerstone of the whole subject.",
        "p4": "The circle is another key figure. With just one formula, C = 2πr, you can calculate the circumference of anything from a bicycle wheel to the Earth's equator. The number π ties the circle to the rest of mathematics in ways that still fascinate mathematicians.",
        "p5": "In the older classes and upper secondary school, you work with coordinate geometry, where figures are described with numbers and equations. A circle becomes x² + y² = r², and distances and angles can be calculated precisely. You also meet solid geometry, working with spheres, cylinders and other three-dimensional shapes.",
        "p6": "Geometry trains your ability to think visually and logically. It's one of the oldest mathematical subjects — the ancient Greeks used it to understand the world — and it's still just as relevant today, from architecture to robotics."
      },
      "trigonometri": {
        "p1": "Trigonometry is about the relationship between angles and sides in triangles. The basic question is: if you know some of the sides and angles in a triangle, can you find the rest? The answer is yes — and trigonometry gives you the methods to do it.",
        "p2": "It all starts with the right-angled triangle and the three fundamental ratios: sine, cosine and tangent. Each describes the ratio between two specific sides of the triangle, depending on which angle you're looking at. With these three tools you can calculate heights, distances and angles that you can't measure directly.",
        "p3": "Trigonometry is incredibly practical. Surveyors use it to calculate distances without walking the whole way. Navigators use it to find position. Engineers use it to design structures. Whenever you need to find an unknown length or angle from what you already know, trigonometry is the answer.",
        "p4": "In upper secondary school, trigonometry expands with the unit circle, which connects angles to coordinates. Sine and cosine become functions that oscillate like waves — and suddenly they can describe everything from sound and light to alternating current and tides.",
        "p5": "You also meet trigonometric identities — formulas that are always true, no matter which angle you put in. And with the sine rule and cosine rule, you can work with all triangles, not just right-angled ones.",
        "p6": "Trigonometry ties geometry and algebra together. It starts with something very concrete — a triangle with sides and angles — and leads you to tools used in everything from physics and engineering to music and computer graphics."

      "vektorer-og-lineaer-algebra": {
        "p1": "A vector is a quantity with both direction and magnitude. Think of it as an arrow: it tells you not just how much, but also where to. Wind has a strength and a direction. A force pushes in a specific direction. Movement has a speed and a heading. All of this is described with vectors.",
        "p2": "In mathematics, we write a vector as a pair or triple of numbers, e.g. (3, 2), describing a movement of 3 to the right and 2 up. You can add vectors, subtract them and multiply them by numbers. These simple operations make it possible to describe and calculate movements, forces and directions precisely.",
        "p3": "The dot product is one of the most important tools in vector algebra. It takes two vectors and returns a single number — and that number tells you something about the angle between them. If the dot product is zero, the vectors are perpendicular. It's an elegant way to measure directions.",
        "p4": "Vectors in space extend the idea to three dimensions. Now you can describe positions, directions and movements in all of space — not just in the plane. You can find equations for lines and planes, calculate distances and intersections, and work with geometry in 3D.",
        "p5": "Linear algebra is about systems of linear equations and the structures that arise. Matrices are rectangular tables of numbers that can describe everything from systems of equations to rotations and transformations. They are an indispensable tool in modern mathematics and computer science.",
        "p6": "Vectors and linear algebra are the mathematical foundation for 3D graphics, machine learning, physics and economics. When a video game renders a 3D world, or an AI analyses data, it's vectors and matrices working behind the scenes."

      "differentialregning": {
        "p1": "Differential calculus is about change. How fast is something growing? When is it increasing, and when is it decreasing? When is it at its highest? If you can describe a quantity with a function, differential calculus can tell you exactly how that quantity is changing.",
        "p2": "The central idea is the derivative — a new function that tells you how fast the original function is growing or shrinking at each point. If f(x) describes your position on a road, then f'(x) describes your speed. And the speed of the speed — f''(x) — is your acceleration.",
        "p3": "Differentiating means finding the derivative, and it turns out to follow surprisingly simple rules. The power rule, the chain rule, the product rule — with a handful of techniques you can differentiate almost any function you encounter. It takes practice, but the patterns fall into place quickly.",
        "p4": "One of the most important applications is finding maxima and minima. When is a function at its highest? That happens where the derivative is zero — the function is neither increasing nor decreasing. This principle is used in optimisation: finding the best solution, whether it's about minimising costs or maximising output.",
        "p5": "Differential calculus also gives you tools to analyse functions thoroughly: turning points, intervals of increase and decrease, curvature and asymptotic behaviour. You can sketch an accurate graph of a function just by analysing its derivatives.",
        "p6": "Differential calculus was developed by Newton and Leibniz in the 1600s and revolutionised mathematics. Today it's used in physics, economics, biology, engineering — everywhere something changes, and we want to understand how."
      },
      "integralregning": {
        "p1": "Integral calculus is the counterpart of differential calculus. Where differentiation is about finding speed from position, integration is about the reverse: finding position from speed. If you know how fast something is growing, the integral can tell you how much it has grown in total.",
        "p2": "The definite integral calculates the area under a curve. That might sound abstract, but it's extremely practical: the area under a speed graph is the distance travelled. The area under a power curve is the total energy consumption. Integrals translate graphs into concrete numbers.",
        "p3": "Integrating in its simplest form means finding an antiderivative — a function whose derivative gives you the function you started with. If the derivative of x² is 2x, then an antiderivative of 2x is x². It's like running differentiation backwards.",
        "p4": "Integration methods like substitution and integration by parts are techniques for handling more complicated functions. Just as differentiation has its rules, integration has its own — they require more creativity, but the principles are clear.",
        "p5": "Integral calculus is also used to calculate volumes of solids of revolution, the length of curves and much more. It's a powerful geometric tool that reaches far beyond simple area calculations.",
        "p6": "Together with differential calculus, integral calculus forms classical analysis — one of the most important and widely applied areas of mathematics. From physics and engineering to economics and probability theory, integrals are an indispensable tool."

        "p1": "Probability and statistics is about understanding data and randomness. What's the chance of rolling a six with a die? What's the average of a class's test scores? Can we trust the results of a poll? These are the kinds of questions this field answers.",
        "p2": "Statistics begins with collecting and describing data. You learn to calculate mean, median and mode, and you learn to display data in charts that make the numbers easy to grasp. It's about getting a clear picture of what the numbers are telling you.",
        "p3": "Probability is about predicting how likely something is. What's the chance of drawing a red card from a deck? What's the chance of winning the lottery? You learn to count possibilities, calculate probabilities and understand how randomness works.",
        "p4": "Combinatorics gives you the tools to count systematically. How many ways can you choose 3 students from a class of 25? How many different codes can you make with 4 digits? It's about counting cleverly instead of counting everything one by one.",
        "p5": "In upper secondary school, you meet probability distributions — mathematical models for random outcomes. The binomial distribution describes, for example, the number of successes in a series of trials, and the normal distribution is the famous bell-shaped curve that appears everywhere in nature and society.",
        "p6": "Statistics and probability are among the most widely applied mathematics today. From medical trials and quality control to machine learning and weather forecasts — the ability to analyse data and assess uncertainty is a crucial skill."

        "p2": "Arithmetic sequences increase or decrease by the same amount each time — like a staircase with equal steps. Geometric sequences are multiplied by the same number each time — they grow explosively fast or shrink towards zero. These two types form the foundation for understanding sequences.",
        "p3": "A series arises when you add the terms of a sequence together. What does 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 100 equal? Gauss found the answer as a child (5050), and the story illustrates nicely what series are about: finding clever ways to calculate sums without adding every number manually.",
        "p4": "Recursive sequences are defined by each term depending on the previous ones. The Fibonacci sequence — 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... — is the most famous example: each number is the sum of the two before it. It appears in nature, from the spirals of sunflowers to nautilus shells.",
        "p5": "In upper secondary school, you work with convergence: what happens when a sequence or series continues to infinity? Some series grow without bound, while others approach a specific number. The geometric series 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ..., for example, approaches exactly 2.",

        "p2": "Length is the most basic measurement. You start with centimetres and metres and learn how the units relate: 100 centimetres make 1 metre, 1000 metres make 1 kilometre. Converting between units is an important skill used all the time in daily life.",
        "p3": "Area measures how large a surface is — from a floor to be laid to a field to be sown. You learn to calculate the area of rectangles, triangles and circles, and you discover that area grows faster than you might expect: a square with sides twice as long has four times the area.",
        "p4": "Volume tells you how much space there is inside something — how many litres of water a container can hold, or how much soil is needed to fill a bed. From boxes and cylinders to spheres and cones, you learn to calculate the volume of the shapes you encounter in everyday life.",
        "p5": "Weight, time and scale are other important measurements. Grams and kilograms for weight, seconds, minutes and hours for time, and scale for maps and drawings, where 1 centimetre on paper can represent 1 kilometre in reality.",
        "p6": "Mastering measurement and units gives you a practical mathematical toolkit you'll use for the rest of your life. It's mathematics you can literally get your hands on."

      "logik-og-bevisteknik": {
        "p1": "Mathematical logic is about thinking precisely. In everyday life we can get by with \"that's probably right\" or \"that makes sense\", but in mathematics we demand certainty. A proof is a chain of logical steps that shows something is true — not just likely, but undeniably true.",
        "p2": "The foundation is propositional logic: statements that are either true or false. \"5 is a prime number\" is true. \"All even numbers are prime\" is false. You learn to combine statements with \"and\", \"or\" and \"not\", and you learn to understand implications: \"if A, then B.\"",
        "p3": "Direct proof is the most straightforward technique: you start with what you know and derive step by step what you want to show. It's like building a bridge from premise to conclusion, where each step must be solid.",
        "p4": "Proof by contradiction is an elegant method where you assume the opposite of what you want to prove and show that it leads to a contradiction. This is how it was proved, for example, that √2 is irrational — it cannot be written as a fraction, no matter how hard you try.",
        "p5": "Proof by induction is used when you want to prove something for all natural numbers. You show it holds for 1, and that if it holds for any number n, it also holds for n + 1. Like dominoes: the first topples the next, which topples the next, forever.",
        "p6": "Logic and proof technique are the foundation on which all of mathematics rests. Even if you never write a formal proof, it strengthens your ability to think clearly, argue precisely, and distinguish between what's been proved and what's merely a guess."

      "finansiel-matematik": {
        "p1": "Financial mathematics is about money and time. The core is a simple but important idea: money today is worth more than the same money in a year — because money can grow when it earns interest. Understanding this relationship is key to making good financial decisions.",
        "p2": "Simple interest is the easiest to understand: you borrow 1000 kr. at 5% per year, and each year you pay 50 kr. in interest. But in practice, compound interest is used, where the interest itself starts earning interest. This is where money really begins to grow — or debt begins to mount.",
        "p3": "The growth factor is the central tool. If the interest rate is 5%, the growth factor is 1.05. Multiplying by it once gives you the amount after one year. Multiplying by it ten times gives you the amount after ten years. That's exponential growth — and it can be surprising how fast it grows.",
        "p4": "Annuities involve fixed payments over time — like a mortgage, where you pay the same amount each month for many years. The mathematics behind it calculates how much you pay in total and how much is interest versus repayment. It's directly useful knowledge for when you one day need to borrow money.",
        "p5": "Index numbers are used to compare values over time: price trends, wage trends or inflation. By setting a base year at 100, you can quickly see whether something has risen or fallen, and by how much.",
        "p6": "Financial mathematics is some of the most directly useful maths you'll learn. It helps you understand savings, loans, investment and the economic news you encounter every day. It's mathematics with pounds and pence."

        "p1": "Set theory is about collecting things into groups and examining how those groups relate. A set is simply a collection of things — numbers, letters, people, anything. {1, 2, 3} is a set. The students in the class who wear glasses form a set. It's a simple but powerful concept.",
        "p2": "The most important question in set theory is: does something belong to the set, or doesn't it? The number 5 belongs to the set of odd numbers. The number 4 doesn't. This simple yes/no logic is the foundation of the whole subject.",
        "p3": "Venn diagrams are the visual tool of set theory. With overlapping circles you can show what two sets have in common and what's unique to each. It makes it easy to see relationships that can be hard to put into words alone.",
        "p4": "Intersection, union and difference are the three basic operations. The intersection is what both groups share. The union is everything in at least one of them. The difference is what's in one but not the other.",
        "p5": "Subsets and complements extend the toolkit. A subset is a set entirely contained within another — like \"girls in the class\" is a subset of \"all students.\" The complement is everything that's not included.",
        "p6": "Set theory is a fundamental language in mathematics. It's used to define number types (natural numbers, integers, real numbers), in probability and in logic. It's easy to get started with, but the ideas reach far."

      "diskret-matematik": {
        "p1": "Discrete mathematics is about things that can be counted: whole numbers, networks, graphs and combinations. Unlike, say, calculus, where everything flows smoothly, discrete mathematics works with separate, countable objects — like steps on a staircase rather than a smooth ramp.",
        "p2": "Graph theory is a central part of discrete mathematics. A graph is a network of points (nodes) connected by lines (edges). It sounds abstract, but it describes everything from road networks and train connections to social networks and the internet. Whenever you want to find the shortest route or the most efficient connection, you're using graph theory.",
        "p3": "A classic problem is the \"bridges of Königsberg\": can you cross all seven bridges in the city exactly once? Euler proved in 1736 that it's impossible — and thereby founded graph theory. It's a good example of how a simple question can lead to an entirely new field of mathematics.",
        "p4": "Number systems also belong here. We normally use the decimal system (base 10), but computers use the binary system (base 2). Understanding how numbers can be written in different bases gives insight into how computers think and calculate.",
        "p5": "Algorithms — step-by-step recipes for solving problems — are at the heart of discrete mathematics and computer science. Sorting data, searching databases and optimising routes are all discrete problems with discrete solutions.",
        "p6": "Discrete mathematics is the part of mathematics closest to computer science. In a world full of computers, networks and data, it's an increasingly important field — and it's surprisingly accessible, because it's about counting, drawing and thinking logically."
